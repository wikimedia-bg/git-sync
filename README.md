# git-sync
Wikipedia system pages in Git (formerly repo-sync and phab-sync)

This [bot](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Bot) provides bidirectional synchronization between various pages on the Bulgarian WMF projects that contain software code and Git repos here on GitHub. Examples of such pages are the JS and CSS pages in the MediaWiki namespace, like `Common.js`, `Common.css`, and various gadgets, and the Lua modules in the Module namespace. This synchronization allows the developers to use their preferred development workflows, as if the code has always resided in Git.
